# 🏍️ Helmet Detection System using YOLOv8  

This project detects whether a person is wearing a helmet using **YOLOv8**. It is trained on a custom dataset and can be used for real-time detection.  

## 🚀 Features  
✔ Detects helmets in images and videos  
✔ Trained on a custom dataset (Roboflow)  
✔ Real-time detection using OpenCV  
✔ Trained in Google Colab, deployed in VS Code  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **Python**  
- **YOLOv8 (Ultralytics)**  
- **OpenCV**  
- **Google Colab**  
- **VS Code**
